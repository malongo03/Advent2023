# Advent2023

This the code* I used to solve each day of the 2023 Advent of Code challenge and achieve (hopefully) all 50 stars.

*The Advent of Code is a timed competition, and so my initial code is always quite messy. It has been edited for readability, with additions such as doc strings, more transparent variable names, and aesthetic changes.
